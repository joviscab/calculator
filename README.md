# Last Odin Project - Calculator!

## Who am I? What is this?

Hello, my name is Joviscab and this is part of my learning to code journey!

This is the last project called Calculator, that is part of the Foundations Course of The Odin Project. The idea of this project is to put to practice all the Javascript knowledge that I have acquired until now. In this project I am going to build a calculator from zero, following the instructions of Odin's lesson! 

## Skills

With this project my idea is to check the Javascript skills that I have learned until now, as well as using it as an exercise to remember all the lessons until this point.

## If you are reading this

Thank you for your interest! It's crazy but I arrived to the last project of Foundations! :)
